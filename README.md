### üöÅ RescueVision: AI-Powered Search & Rescue Command Center

An end-to-end, multi-modal AI system designed to accelerate search and rescue (SAR) operations. This full-stack application functions as a professional-grade **after-action review and intelligence gathering tool**, allowing operators to rapidly analyze hours of aerial drone footage and pinpoint critical events with pixel-perfect accuracy.

The platform is built on a robust microservices architecture, fusing two powerful, custom-built AI capabilities into a single, intuitive interface: a high-performance **Computer Vision survivor detection pipeline** and a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Mission AI Assistant** grounded in official FEMA SAR manuals.

#### **Key Achievements & Performance Metrics:**

*   **Flawless UX for High-Stakes Analysis:** Architected a sophisticated "Event Reviewer" workflow. Operators upload a video, which is processed by the backend. The UI then populates a log of all detected events. Clicking an event jumps the video to the precise timestamp and draws a **static, pixel-perfect bounding box**, eliminating the ambiguity and latency of real-time trackers.
*   **High-Performance Custom CV Model:** Engineered and trained a state-of-the-art **YOLOv8n object detection model** from scratch on a challenging aerial dataset of over **2,200 images**. Achieved exceptional performance metrics on the validation set, proving the model's accuracy in identifying small, difficult-to-detect human figures from above:
    *   **Precision:** **85.3%**
    *   **Recall:** **76.2%**
    *   **mAP50:** **0.833**
*   **Authoritative RAG-Powered AI Assistant:** Built a complete RAG pipeline using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB**.
