# Hi, I'm Ehsanul. üëã
## End-to-End AI Engineer | LLMs, RAG, NLP, & MLOps

I build intelligent, data-driven applications from prototype to production. My passion lies in taking complex AI concepts‚Äîfrom Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to traditional NLP‚Äîand engineering them into deployed, containerized, and scalable applications that solve real-world problems.

üß† **My specialization is in End-to-End AI & MLOps:** I excel at building and deploying complex AI systems, including RAG pipelines and AI agents, by optimizing for production constraints like cost, privacy, and performance.

üöÄ **I deliver production-ready solutions:** I have hands-on experience with the full lifecycle: from model selection and prompt engineering to containerization (Docker), cloud deployment, and local inference with tools like Ollama. I'm adept at working across diverse environments and time zones.

üåê **Fluent in English:** Duolingo English Test (DET) score of 135/160 (equivalent to IELTS 7.0).
