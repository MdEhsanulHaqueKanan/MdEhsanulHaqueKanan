# Hi, I'm Ehsanul. 👋

## End-to-End Machine Learning Engineer | NLP, MLOps, & Deep Learning

I build intelligent, data-driven applications from prototype to production. My passion lies in taking complex machine learning concepts—from Natural Language Processing to Computer Vision—and engineering them into deployed, containerized, and scalable web applications that solve real-world problems.

- 🧠 **My specialization is in End-to-End NLP & MLOps:** I excel at deploying resource-intensive models by optimizing for production constraints.
- 🚀 **I deliver production-ready solutions:** I have hands-on experience with the full lifecycle: data analysis, model development, containerization (Docker), cloud deployment (Render), and production troubleshooting.

### ✨ Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of. They demonstrate my ability to handle the entire machine learning lifecycle, from a Jupyter Notebook to a live, user-facing application.

### 🧠 NLP Disease Diagnosis System (My Latest Work)
A full-stack, end-to-end NLP application that assists users in identifying potential diseases from natural language symptoms. This project showcases advanced MLOps skills, including model optimization for production environments and debugging live deployment issues. The deployed version uses a memory-efficient Sentence-Transformer model to run reliably on a resource-constrained server.

*   **Highlights:** Solved real-world deployment challenges, including "Out of Memory" errors by making a pragmatic engineering trade-off between model size and performance. Containerized with Docker for reproducible deployment.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, Sentence-Transformers, Scikit-Learn, Docker, Gunicorn, Render.
