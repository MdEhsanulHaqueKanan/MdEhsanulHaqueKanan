# Hi, I'm Ehsanul. 👋

## End-to-End Machine Learning Engineer | From Prototype to Production

I specialize in building intelligent, data-driven applications. My passion lies in taking machine learning concepts from initial exploratory analysis all the way to deployed, interactive web applications that solve real-world problems.

I am currently available for freelance projects and collaborations. If you have an idea, let's build it together!

- 🔭 **Currently building:** A **Processor Recommendation Engine** to help users select the perfect chip for their smart device needs.
- 🌱 **I thrive on diverse challenges:** My expertise covers recommendation systems, time-series classification, and deep learning for computer vision.
- 🚀 **I deliver production-ready code:** I have hands-on experience with containerization (Docker) and CI/CD, ensuring my applications are scalable and maintainable.

### 🚧 What I'm Currently Building

### 🧠 Processor Recommendation Engine for Smart Devices
I'm currently developing a **decision-support tool** designed to help engineers and product teams streamline the hardware selection process for new smart devices.

This engine allows technical teams to input specific requirements (e.g., architecture, core configuration) and instantly receive a curated list of processors that meet their criteria. To offer deeper insights, the system is enhanced with machine learning models for:
*   **Chip Classification:** Predicting a processor's primary function (e.g., SoC, application processor) or its likely designer, providing valuable data for competitive analysis.
*   **Feature Prediction:** Inferring technical capabilities (e.g., supported wireless protocols) from core architecture alone, aiding in early-stage design when full specifications may be unavailable.

By combining direct recommendations with predictive intelligence, the tool aims to significantly reduce R&D cycles and ensure optimal component selection for any smart device, from IoT sensors to high-performance tablets.

*   **Status:** Currently in the data exploration and feature engineering phase.
*   **Coming Soon:** A deployed Flask application where engineering teams can find the perfect chip for their next product.
*   **Core Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Flask.
