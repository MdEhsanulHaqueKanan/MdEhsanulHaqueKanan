# Hi, I'm Ehsanul. 👋

## End-to-End Machine Learning Engineer | From Prototype to Production

I specialize in building intelligent, data-driven applications. My passion lies in taking machine learning concepts from initial exploratory analysis all the way to deployed, interactive web applications that solve real-world problems.

I am currently available for freelance projects and collaborations. If you have an idea, let's build it together!

- 🌱 **I thrive on diverse challenges:** My expertise covers recommendation systems, time-series classification, and deep learning for computer vision.
- 🚀 **I deliver production-ready code:** I have hands-on experience with containerization (Docker) and deploying scalable, real-world applications.
