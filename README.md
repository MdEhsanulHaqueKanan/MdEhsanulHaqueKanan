# Hi, I'm Ehsanul. 👋

## End-to-End AI Engineer | LLMs, RAG, NLP, & MLOps

I build intelligent, data-driven applications from prototype to production. My passion lies in taking complex AI concepts—from Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to traditional NLP—and engineering them into deployed, containerized, and scalable applications that solve real-world problems.

- 🧠 **My specialization is in End-to-End AI & MLOps:** I excel at building and deploying complex AI systems, including RAG pipelines and AI agents, by optimizing for production constraints like cost, privacy, and performance.
- 🚀 **I deliver production-ready solutions:** I have hands-on experience with the full lifecycle: from model selection and prompt engineering to containerization (Docker), cloud deployment, and local inference with tools like Ollama.
