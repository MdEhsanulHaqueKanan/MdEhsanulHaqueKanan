# Hi, I'm Ehsanul. 👋

## End-to-End AI Engineer | LLMs, RAG, NLP, & MLOps

I build intelligent, data-driven applications from prototype to production. My passion lies in taking complex AI concepts—from Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to traditional NLP—and engineering them into deployed, containerized, and scalable applications that solve real-world problems.

- 🧠 **My specialization is in End-to-End AI & MLOps:** I excel at building and deploying complex AI systems, including RAG pipelines and AI agents, by optimizing for production constraints like cost, privacy, and performance.
- 🚀 **I deliver production-ready solutions:** I have hands-on experience with the full lifecycle: from model selection and prompt engineering to containerization (Docker), cloud deployment, and local inference with tools like Ollama.

### ✨ Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of. They demonstrate my ability to handle the entire AI/ML lifecycle, from a Jupyter Notebook to a live, user-facing application.

### 🧠 AI Research Assistant (with Local LLM & RAG)
A full-stack, end-to-end AI agent that answers complex questions with up-to-date, sourced information. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of modern AI agent architecture, running a 100% private and cost-free stack with a local LLM (Phi-3) and a robust, orchestrated RAG workflow.

*   **Highlights:** Engineered a complete solution using a **local-first stack (Ollama)**, ensuring data privacy and zero API costs. Designed and implemented a robust **orchestrated RAG workflow** after diagnosing and overcoming the limitations of a fully autonomous agent. Built a polished, interactive UI with **Streamlit**.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, LangChain, Streamlit, Ollama, Phi-3, DuckDuckGo Search.
*   **[📂 Source Code](https://github.com/MdEhsanulHaqueKanan/ai-research-assistant)** *(Note: This project runs locally to ensure 100% data privacy and has no live deployment.)*

### 🤖 NLP Disease Diagnosis System
A full-stack NLP application that assists users in identifying potential diseases from natural language symptoms. This project showcases advanced MLOps skills, including model optimization for production environments and debugging live deployment issues.

*   **Highlights:** Solved real-world deployment challenges, including "Out of Memory" errors by making a pragmatic engineering trade-off between model size and performance. Containerized with Docker for reproducible deployment.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, Sentence-Transformers, Scikit-Learn, Docker, Gunicorn, Render.
